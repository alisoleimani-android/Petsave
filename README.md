# Petsave

PetSave is a pet adoption and fostering app that aggregates and matches animals available to you. It uses the medical history of the pet along with some of your personal information for matching and searching.

The app connects to an external service, which it uses to fetch the animals. This service, Petfinder, is an online, searchable database of animals who need homes. They also have information on shelters and adoption organizations across the United States. Check out their site at https://www.petfinder.com/. Who knows, you might find your new pet. :]
